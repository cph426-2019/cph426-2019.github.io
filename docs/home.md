# UNC Computer Science in Copenhagen

Learn about modern world wide web development from across the world in Denmark's lovely Copenhagen. Immerse yourself in Danish design and embrace its functionalism when learning to design your own web apps. Cultural engagement opportunities will integrate participants into the local culture where they will gain academic knowledge and intercultural skills to prepare for a globalized world.

At the conclusion of the program, students will be able to:

* design and develop a complete, modern web application using a combination of front-end (HTML5 and JavaScript) and back-end (custom server programs, APIs, and data stores) technologies
* recognize the global reach of modern web applications and the challenges of serving a locality and geographically diverse audience
* compare and select appropriate technical solutions for common web application use-cases and requirements
* practice common systems administration / developer operations techniques in provisioning and deploying applications to a production environment
* apply best practices in software engineering and security to the web development process
* differentiate and classify today's leading platforms, tools, and frameworks
* develop a web application whose content aligns with the study abroad experience that will serve as a portfolio piece in the internship hiring process
